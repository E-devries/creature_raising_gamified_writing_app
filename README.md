# creature_raising_gamified_writing_app
A lightweight gamified writing application that ties writing goals to raising a virtual pet

## main purpose
The purpose of this app is to allow the user to set writing goals as strict or lenient as they want and reward the user for meeting those goals. One main way the user is rewarded is by translating met goals into resources for raising a virtual creature, inspired by other creature raising simulators such as tamagotchi and the chao garden from sonic adventure games. The other main way the user is rewarded is by tracking and displaying when writing goals are met and exceeded, as well as the length of time the user can consistently meet their writing goals. The philosophy and purpose behind this application is positive reinforcement over discouragement, so the focus will always be on rewarding writing progress and avoiding mechanics that may distract from the main purpose of encouraging writing.
